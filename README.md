# Running Man Animation Game Programming using Haxe
## Summary:
The exercise is build using Haxeflixel. The animation shows the player running in two different 
directions when specific keys (LEFT AND RIGHT) are pressed. When no keys are pressed, the
frame is set to one graphic image, showing the player in idle position.

## Using the Game:

Run the command “lime test neko”. 
Currently, the player is only able to move in left and right directions. To make the player run in 
left direction, press the LEFT arrow key on keyboard.
